        <h3 class="favorite__title">Why John Wick is My Favorite</h3>
        <ul class="favorite__reasons">
          <li class="favorite__reason">
            <strong>The intense and well-choreographed action scenes.</strong>
            <p>
              John Wick is renowned for its exceptional action sequences. The fight choreography in
              the movies is intense and incredibly well-executed. It's a visual treat for action
              movie enthusiasts. The film's dedication to realism and practical effects make every
              fight feel gritty and impactful. Keanu Reeves' commitment to performing many of his
              stunts adds authenticity to the action, drawing the audience into the heart-pounding
              battles.

            <strong>Keanu Reeves' incredible performance as John Wick.</strong>
            <p>
              Keanu Reeves' portrayal of the titular character is one of the standout aspects of the
              franchise. He brings depth and emotional resonance to a character who could have been
              one-dimensional in the hands of a lesser actor. Reeves' stoic yet nuanced performance
              allows viewers to connect with John Wick on a personal level. His ability to convey
              grief, determination, and a sense of honor makes John Wick a compelling and relatable
              hero.

            <strong>The intriguing and immersive world-building in the movies.</strong>
            <p>
              John Wick doesn't just deliver action; it creates an intricate and immersive fictional
              world. The film introduces audiences to an underground society of assassins, each with
              its code of ethics and unique rules. This world-building adds depth to the narrative
              and keeps viewers engaged beyond the action scenes. The Continental Hotel, where
              assassins gather, is a prime example of the attention to detail in creating this
              fascinating universe. It's a world where every action has consequences, and the lore
              intrigues the story.
            </p>

        <p>
          These three elements combine to make John Wick a series of action films and a franchise
          that stands out for its dedication to quality in action choreography, character
          development, and world-building. It's no wonder that John Wick has garnered a dedicated
          fan base and is considered a modern classic in the action genre.
